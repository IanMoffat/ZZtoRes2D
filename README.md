# ZZtoRes2D
Spreadsheets which convert ZZ ERT data to Res2D format

These Excel files are used to convert files of ERT data generated by the ZZ RData Check Program into a file format which can used by Res2D to undertake inversions.  It also allows the opportunity to filter these data based on n or V/I values.

R script to do this is now available here https://github.com/IanMoffat/ZZ_ERT_Conversion
